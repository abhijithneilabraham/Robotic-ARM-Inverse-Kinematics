# Robotic-ARM-Inverse-Kinematics
using inverse kinematics to make a robotic arm, and using tinyik to solve the coordinates and angles

The file ik.py has the program,for 3 link Robotic arm.I put a reference image here ,in case you'd like to look at how the axis and movement look like,and change it.
